Code for Progress program analysis and visualization tools
==========================================================

This node.js app makes use of the D3.js library to visualize quantative and qualitative data related to the metrics of success set for the 2014 Code for Progress fellowship program.


Why a node.js app for a program that teaches Python/Django?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Fellows train in Agile methodology to build rapid prototypes of apps, interfaces, and data tools that can help social justice-focused organizations achieve their missions around managing user info and interacting with members and clients. Given those needs, a program scope that required only an introductory focus on analytics and visualization specialists, and the Python community's traction in the national social justice movement's data field, Python and the Flask/Django frameworks were the appropriate choices for preparing our fellows.

Staff responsibilities are another matter. Analysis and visualization are rigorous components of a strong fellowship program - and in 2014, the D3.js library outstrips Python options.
